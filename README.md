# dissertationMLCA

For Aim 2 of my dissertation I used multilevel latent class analysis (MLCA) to create relationship typologies for the adolescent mother and community levels. Using Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) data, the MCLA used 5 variables: knowledge of partner HIV status, age disparity, married or cohabiting, transactional sex, and financial dependence. MLCA was conduted in three steps using MPlus:<br /> 
<br />
Step 1: identify the number of latent classes at level-1 (adolescent mothers). <br />
Step 2: Identify number of latent classes at level-2 (communities). <br />
Step 3: Confirm latent classes at level-1 given level-2's latent classes. <br />

As a sensitive analysis,  I created typologies for adolescent mothers' sexual relationships ignoring the nested structure (dissertation_LCA.Rmd).
