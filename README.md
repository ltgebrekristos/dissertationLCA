For Aim 2 of my dissertation I use latent class analysis (sensitive analysis) to create typologies for adolescent mothers' sexual relationships. The latent class analysis uses 5 variables: knowledge of partner HIV status, age disparity, married or cohabiting, transactional sex, and financial dependence. Model selection is guided by goodness-of-fit statistics: Lo-Mendall likelihood ratio test, adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (aBIC), and consistent Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (cAIC).
